# Google Fit Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing personal fitness activity data collected from Google Fit.
The objective is to explore daily activity patterns, understand user behavior, and extract
meaningful insights related to physical activity, calorie burn, and movement trends.

The analysis demonstrates how raw health data can be transformed into actionable insights
using data analytics and visualization techniques.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains daily activity metrics, including:
- Step count
- Calories burned
- Distance covered
- Activity duration
- Date-wise activity tracking

The data is stored in:
Daily activity metrics.csv

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on fitness activity data  
- Identify trends in physical activity over time  
- Analyze relationships between steps, calories, and distance  
- Visualize patterns to support data-driven health insights  

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The analysis follows a structured data analytics workflow:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Visualization of key metrics
5. Insight generation

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Daily activity levels vary significantly across time periods
- Higher step counts are strongly associated with increased calorie burn
- Activity consistency plays a key role in overall fitness trends
- Certain days show noticeably higher activity, indicating behavioral patterns

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook:Google_Fit_Data_Analysis.ipynb
4. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

Results & Conclusion

This project highlights how fitness data can be analyzed to understand activity behavior
and health trends. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for designing
personalized fitness goals, monitoring progress, and encouraging consistent physical activity.
